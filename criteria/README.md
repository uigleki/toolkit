# Tool Selection Framework

A systematic approach to evaluating and selecting tools based on long-term value.

## Why Open Source First

1. Enhanced security (auditable code)
2. Community can fork if project direction diverges from user needs

## Evaluation Formula

```
Tool Value = Efficiency Gain - Usage Cost
```

### Efficiency Gain

- Significance of the problem solved
- Completeness of the solution
- Actual speed improvement achieved

### Usage Cost

- Initial learning time
- Configuration effort
- Long-term maintenance burden
- Flexibility limitations

## Selection Standards

A worthwhile tool should:

1. Solve a clear and significant problem
2. Provide well-thought-out default configurations
3. Require near-zero maintenance
4. Not overly restrict use cases

## Case Studies

### Positive Examples

1. Nix Package Manager
   - Gain: Direct software installation without repositories or manual setup
   - Cost: Intuitive configuration, simple maintenance
   - Conclusion: High-value tool
2. Helix Editor
   - Gain: Well-designed key bindings with all essential features
   - Cost: Sensible defaults, nearly zero maintenance
   - Conclusion: Reliable terminal editor

### Consideration Examples

1. NixOS
   - Gain: Unified system configuration management
   - Cost: Steep learning curve, heavy maintenance burden
   - Conclusion: Cost outweighs benefits
2. Neovim
   - Gain: VSCode-like features with superior performance
   - Cost: Complex configuration, continuous plugin maintenance needed
   - Conclusion: Not worth the effort

## Conclusion

When selecting tools, focus on:

1. Scale of practical problems solved
2. Required learning and maintenance investment
3. Long-term sustainability

Tools should enhance productivity without becoming maintenance overhead.
